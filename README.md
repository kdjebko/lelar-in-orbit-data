# LeLaR In-Orbit Data

This repository contains the telemetry data from the in-orbit experiments described in the paper **“LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller”**.  
Initial preprint available on arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576)  
A link to the final paper, as well as a license, will be added once available.

The experiment data, on which the figures from the paper (partially cropped for illustration purposes) are based, can be found in the folder *maneuver_data*. The data has a nominal time resolution of 2 seconds and is provided in the form it was extracted from the InnoCube mission's Grafana dashboard.

The maneuvers *lelar_base_agent/30.10.2025 10.40-10.50/*, *lelar_flight_agent_sim2real_discrepancies/08.12.2025 22.19-22.25/* and *lelar_flight-agent/13.12.2025 11.28-11.34/* and the data from *rw_speed_spike* are based on live-telemetry. The maneuvers *lelar_flight_agent/15.12.2025 09.31-09.49/*, *lelar_flight_agent/17.12.2025 20.46-21.01/*, *pd/15.12.2025 21.50-22.05/* and *pd/15.12.2025 22.30-22.48/* are based on offline-telemetry.
